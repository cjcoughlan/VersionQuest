"VersionQuest Readme" 

Ever had to arbitrarily look up version info for a number greater than what you've entered?  Your sleepless nights are over.

The front-end project is currently set up to use https (soon to be fixed) so to run via debug, you should trust the IIS express cert.

Happy version hunting!
